Order sailors by loyalty band and randomize.
Order boats by loyalty band and randomize.
Calculate overall_min and overall_max.
Switch:
	1. sailors < overall_min
	2. sailors > overall_max
	3. the rest
Case 1: 
	remove boats by order
	until sailors >= overall_min (assume <= overall_max)
	case 3
Case 2:
	occupancy = occupancy_max
	reduce sailors by order
	until sailors <= overall_max
	case 3
Case 3:
	occupancy = occupancy_min
	while sailors > overall_occupancy
		order boats by headroom and randomize
		increment first boat occupancy by 1
for boats in loyalty order
	for sailors in loyalty order
		assign sailors to boats up to occupancy
		check compliance
